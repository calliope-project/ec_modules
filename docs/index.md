Welcome to the [`ec_modules`](https://github.com/calliope-project/ec_modules) repository!

We aim to be a collection of helper workflows and wrappers that aid in quickly developing Energy System (ESM) models, inspired by Snakemake's [workflow catalog](https://snakemake.github.io/snakemake-workflow-catalog/) and [wrapper repository](https://snakemake-wrappers.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).
Our main purpose is enabling energy researchers to share data workflows between studies to avoid the [bloat](./about/reasoning.md#bloat-and-reproducibility) problem in large energy system workflows.
