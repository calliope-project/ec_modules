# Getting started

We assume you already have `conda` or `mamba` installed in your system.
If you don't, We recommend following `mamba`'s [installation advice](https://github.com/mamba-org/mamba), as it is much faster than regular `conda`.

1. Clone this repository and change into it.

    ```shell
    git clone git@github.com:calliope-project/ec_modules.git
    cd ec_modules
    ```

2. Create a `conda` environment with our setup and activate it.

    ```shell
    conda env create -f environment.yml
    conda activate ec_modules
    ```

3. Create your module or wrapper using one of our standard [`copier`](https://github.com/copier-org/copier) templates.

    ??? example "Example: using a module template"

        With the `ec_modules` environment activated, type:

        ```shell
        copier copy modules/_template/ modules/
        ```

        You'll be promted with some questions. After answering them, `copier` will auto-generate the module for you!

        ```html
        ðŸŽ¤ What is your module's name?
        wind_offshore
        ðŸŽ¤ Please give a brief sentence describing your module.
        A module to estimate offshore-wind potentials for arbitrary subregions in Europe.

        ```

    ??? example "Example: using a wrapper template"

        Similar to the module example, call `copier` with the following:

        ```shell
        copier copy wrappers/_template/ wrappers/
        ```

        In the case of wrappers, there are some additional answers you must provide.

        ```html
        ðŸŽ¤ What is the name of the tool you are designing a wrapper for?
        gregor
        ðŸŽ¤ Please provide a valid link to the tool's official website.
        https://github.com/jnnr/gregor
        ðŸŽ¤ What is the name of the wrapper?
        snip
        ðŸŽ¤ Please give a brief sentence describing your wrapper.
        Snip a raster file into a smaller raster file.
