# Getting started

We assume you already have `conda` or `mamba` installed in your system.
If you don't, We recommend following `mamba`'s [installation advice](https://github.com/mamba-org/mamba), as it is much faster than regular `conda`.

1. Clone this repository and change into it.

    ```shell
    git clone git@github.com:calliope-project/ec_modules.git
    cd ec_modules
    ```

2. Create a `conda` environment with our setup and activate it.

    ```shell
    conda env create -f environment.yml
    conda activate ec_modules
    ```

3. Create your module or wrapper using one of our standard [`copier`](https://github.com/copier-org/copier) templates.

    ??? example "Example: using a module template"

        With the `ec_modules` environment activated, type:

        ```shell
        copier copy modules/_template/ modules/
        ```

        You'll be promted with some questions. After answering them, `copier` will auto-generate the module for you!

        ```html
        ðŸŽ¤ What is your module's name?
        electrical_transmission
        ðŸŽ¤ Please give a brief sentence describing your module.
        A module to estimate transmission capacities between subregions in Europe.
